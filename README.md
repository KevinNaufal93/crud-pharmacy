# crud-pharmacy
Apothecary administration web application for Profindo recruitment test. Uses React, Node/Express JS and MySQL.

# How to start
1. Start the backend!
    a. CD to backend directory, the crud-pharmacy in the root folder doesnt contain react structure folders so have to cd crud-pharmacy again ("cd crud-pharmacy" => "cd src" => "cd backend").
    b. Type "nodemon index.js"
2. Start the frontend(React)
    a. CD to crud-pharmacy ("cd crud-pharmacy")
    b. Type "npm start"

P.S. Database dumps for import is in backend/database folder

That's it!
Thanks
